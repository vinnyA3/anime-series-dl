Hi! :wave:  Thank you for contributing to the project, I hope you have fun!

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue (*preferred*),
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

Please note we have a Code of Conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Please use correct labels for the status of your PR (ie. `Work in Progress`,
   `Ready for Review`, `Help Wanted` ... etc).
2. Ensure any existing test pipelines are passing before marking the Pull
   Request as `Ready for Review`.
    - New tests, and improving test cases are welcome!  Please make sure an
      additional unit tests are passing as well.
3. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new
   variables, supported environments, exposed ports, useful file locations and command (or container) parameters.
4. *If Applicable* - Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
5. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Commit Style

To faciliate an easy merging process (and possible rollbacks -- in the event of introducted
crashes/bugs), it is desired to take an atomic commit approach: each commit
should pertain to a single fix or feature.  There is room for compromise, if it
makes sense, but too many commits should be avoided.  You can refer to the
following for more on atomic commit methodology:

This project loosely follows the [angular commit style](https://gist.github.com/brianclements/841ea7bffdb01346392c).  As
a **TL:DR**, the general commit structure should look like the following:
```
doc(readme): update contributing information

This commit updates the contributing markdown link

Resolves: #14

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and
orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project owner at
`vincent.aceto@gmail.com`. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. I, @vinnyA3 and the
Project Team, is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
